"""Resolution is a pure function of the raw input plus this node's environment.

The end state for the configuration tier keeps ``ServerArgs`` at the user's raw
input and lets every process that publishes derive the resolved values itself
(bags do not cross a process boundary — a child projects its own from the record
it is handed). That is only sound if resolving the same raw input twice gives
the same answer, so this pins it:

- twice in this process, from equal raw inputs, every field agrees;
- the resolution is not order-dependent on a shared registry (a second config
  resolved after the first does not inherit its declarations);
- the raw record the two started from is itself unchanged by resolving a
  sibling.

A failure here means some resolution step reads state it also writes, and the
"re-derive in the child" contract would silently diverge between the launcher
and its schedulers.
